#Notes on Wii Nunchuk

Note: This is based on debugging statements added to r11 code in the SVN repository.

= Notes on Wii Nunchuk =
 * When Joystick centered:
  * Raw: (x,y) = 121,125
  * Normalized (x,y) = -6,-2
  * Motor (Left,Right) = 90,90
 * When Joystick straight up (full forward):
  * Raw: (x,y) = 126,219
  * Normalized (x,y) = -2,93
  * Motor (Left,Right) = 133,133
 * When Joystick full down (full reverse):
  * Raw: (x,y) = 120,29
  * Normalized (x,y) = -7,-99
  * Motor (Left,Right) = 51,50
 * When Joystick full right (spin):
  * Raw: (x,y) = 221,130
  * Normalized (x,y) = 95,3
  * Motor (Left,Right) = 135,55
 * When Joystick full left (spin):
  * Raw: (x,y) = 29,126
  * Normalized (x,y) = -99,-1
  * Motor (Left,Right) = 139,50

This suggest that:
  * Raw values range from about 29 to 221 for the joystick, with a center value of 120. 
  * Values appear to have 1 - 3 counts of noise.
  * Not sure that values are the same for all Wiimote Nunchucks.
  * Possible to get approximately a +/- 100 count value just by subtracting off the midpoint, maybe?
